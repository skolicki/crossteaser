# crossteaser

A brute-force solver for Crossteaser puzzle (http://www.recenttoys.com/project/crossteaser/)

Solves by searching state from the initial one forward, and from the final state
backward, looking for a common middle state, and concatenating paths

Yes, it can be further shortened, improved and enhanced, but it served the purpose for today :)
